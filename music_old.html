<h2>Here are some of My Musical endeavors</h2>
<h3>Happy Morbid Fun Train</h3>
<p>In high school, I got together with some friends and formed a metal band. We played one show, recorded two songs, and called ourselves Happy Morbid Fun Train. Here is one of those tracks, with the imaginative title HMFT 1.</p>

<p>And here is the other one, with the oddly numbered title HMFT 3.</p>

<p>Later, I did a stint as a jazz pianist, playing at a few open jams in the Chicago area.</p>
